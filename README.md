# Neon Dungeon
A tiny procedural Roguelike.

Lost in a vibrant labyrinth illuminated just by its glowing neon walls, you must search for a way out - but beware, you are not alone in here.

Do you have what it takes to escape the Neon Dungeon?

I have originally created the game for the [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) JavaScript coding competition in 2017 for the theme 'lost'.

This repo will contain an improved, post-compo version but you will be able to try the original build submitted to the compo at this permalink:

## Controls
- Move around: arrows / WASD / HJKL
- Attack: space / X / F

## Supported browsers
The game should work fine in recent builds of any modern desktop browser. Proper ES6 and WebGL support is required but these are fortunately commonplace these days.

I have successfully tested it under the latest releases of:
- Chrome (Linux and macOS)
- Firefox (Linux and macOS)
- Opera (Linux and macOS)
- Safari (macOS)
